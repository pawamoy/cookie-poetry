# Cookie Poetry

<!-- badge list -->
Cookiecutter for Poetry projects.

> :warning: I am now using [copier-poetry](https://github.com/pawamoy/copier-poetry),
which is a very similar (and better!) template,
but based on [copier](https://github.com/pykong/copier)
instead of [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter).

This cookiecutter is mainly for my own usage,
but feel free to try it out, or fork it!
